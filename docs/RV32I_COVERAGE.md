## Additional Privileged Instructions (Beyond RV32I)

While RV32I is 100% complete, the simulator also supports additional privileged instructions and mechanisms useful for operating system support:

### Trap/Exception Instructions (1)
| Instruction | Opcode | Description | Status |
|------------|--------|-------------|--------|
| MRET | 0x73 | Machine Return from Trap | ✅ Full implementation |

**MRET Implementation:**
- Restores PC from mepc CSR (0x341)
- Restores interrupt enable: mstatus.MPIE → mstatus.MIE
- Sets mstatus.MPIE to 1
- Restores privilege mode from mstatus.MPP
- Clears mstatus.MPP to User mode (0)
- Essential for FreeRTOS and other RTOS support
- 13 comprehensive tests covering all CSR state transitions

### Trap/Interrupt Mechanism ✅

Complete trap and interrupt handling system:

**Exception Handling:**
- Synchronous exceptions (ECALL, EBREAK, illegal instruction)
- Automatic trap entry with CSR state save
- Exception codes: misaligned, illegal instruction, breakpoint, environment call
- mtval support for faulting address/instruction
- 26 comprehensive tests

**Interrupt Support:**
- Three interrupt types: Software, Timer, External
- Priority-based interrupt delivery
- Global enable (mstatus.MIE) and per-interrupt enable (mie CSR)
- Interrupt pending tracking (mip CSR)
- Direct and vectored trap modes (mtvec)

**CSR State Management:**
- mepc: Exception program counter (saved PC)
- mstatus: Status with MIE/MPIE/MPP for trap entry/exit
- mcause: Trap cause (exception code or interrupt with MSB)
- mtval: Trap value (address, instruction bits)
- mtvec: Trap handler base with mode
- mie/mip: Interrupt enable and pending bits

**Key Features:**
- Complete trap entry: Save PC, disable interrupts, save privilege
- Complete trap exit: MRET restores all saved state
- Interrupt priority: External > Software > Timer
- Vectored interrupts: Separate handler per interrupt type
- Ready for FreeRTOS and bare-metal OS development
